## Traditional Machine Learning 

* [Car Price Prediction using Linear Regression](https://github.com/danielnavarro2911/datascience-portfolio/blob/main/car-price-prediction-linear-regression.ipynb) - Using linear regression with Scikit-learn for the prediction of car prices. The predicted values are close to the actual values that a customer can estimate the price of a car with an error of $3,200.
In the end we improved a little the results using TensorFlow to an error of $3018

* [Car Insurance Claim Prediction](https://github.com/danielnavarro2911/datascience-portfolio/blob/main/customer-car-insurance-version3.ipynb) - Using Logistic Regression with Scikit-learn for Car Insurance Claim Prediction. We are obtaining a general accuracy of 82%, where if it is predicted that the client uses the insurance, there is a 73% probability that he will use it. Since we deal with insurance, it's a good prediction..
